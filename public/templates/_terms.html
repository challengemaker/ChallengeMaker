<h4>1.	Challenges.</h4>
a.	A “Challenge” is an invitation posted on the Site to (i) accomplish a goal or engage in an activity (collectively, the “Challenge Activity”) or (ii) donate a suggested amount (the “Suggested Contribution”) to the Selected Charity (as defined below).  The “Challenger” with respect to any Challenge is the person who posts such Challenge on the Site.  A “Challengee” with respect to any Challenge is someone who accepts such Challenge via the Site.  A “Selected Charity” with respect to any Challenge is the charity selected as such by the applicable Challenger from among the charities that register with the Service.  References herein to “you” may include Challengers, Challengees or both, as the context shall require.
b.	Challengers may post Challenges and content related to Challenges or Challenge Activities as audiovisual recordings, audio recordings, text, or by any other reasonable means of digital communication that is supported by the Site.  Challengees may accept any Challenge by clicking on the “Accept” button or similar button or other graphic element designed for use in indicating acceptance of such Challenge on the Site and may post audiovisual, audio, textual or other content in connection with such acceptance or otherwise relating to such Challenge or Challenge Activity.  Audiovisual, audio and other posts related to Challenges may be posted to third party websites such as youtube.com and may be accessible both from the Site and from such third party website.
c.	Anyone who visits the Site may view and accept Challenges.  Additionally, the Site will enable Challengers automatically to notify selected friends or associates of the Challenge via email or via notification systems involving social media services.  Finally, Challengees may expand the group of persons who are specifically notified of the Challenge by arranging for similar notifications of such Challenge to be sent to their friends or associates.
d.	If a Challengee accepts a Challenge, he or she will either (i) perform the Challenge Activity within the time specified in the Challenge or, if no such time is specified, then within a reasonable time, and may post a video or other content relating to his or her performance of such Challenge to the Site, or (ii) make the Suggested Contribution via the Site to the Selected Charity in a timely manner.
e.	Challengers must explain Challenges and Challenge Activity clearly and at a level of detail that is reasonably sufficient under the circumstances.  Challenge Activity must be lawful, safe and not harmful to the health or wellbeing of Challenger, any Challengee or anyone else.  Challenge Activity should be fun for or beneficial to Challengees.  Challenges should not be mean spirited or offensive and shall in no event involve (i) drinking alcoholic beverages excessively or otherwise irresponsibly, (ii) pharmaceutical products or controlled substances or any related paraphernalia, (iii) weapons, ammunition or related accessories, (iv) sexual activity or nudity, (v) gambling or any contest, competition, sweepstake or similar activity, (vi) cruelty to animals or (vii) other immoral or inappropriate conduct.  Challengemaker has no obligation to review any Challenges or to evaluate any Challenges or Challenge Activity for lawfulness, safety or any other purpose, provided that Challengemaker retains the right to do so.  Challengemaker reserves the right to take down or refuse to post any Challenge at any time, for any reason, in its sole discretion.  Challengers and Challengees are solely responsible for ensuring that any Challenge and Challenge Activity is lawful, safe and not harmful and that it otherwise complies with this Contract.  You assume all of the risk associated with your participation in any Challenge or Challenge Activity.
f.	Challenges may not include any commercial, advertising or promotional content or activities.  Although challenges may involve purchases of certain categories or types of goods or services, they may not specify or require the purchase of any specified brand or product.  For example, a Challenge may involve eating more organic foods, but it may not specify what brand of organic food to buy or where to buy it.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Challenge that is targeted to Challengees based upon their association with a commercial venture, such as a Challenge presented by a business to its employees or customers, may involve Challenge Activities relating to such business or its products or services.
g.	Neither Challengers nor Challengees may receive any cash, goods or other consideration in connection with any Challenge or Challenge Activity or any charitable contributions.  No Challenger or Challengee shall (i) make any statement regarding any Challenge or any Challenge Activity that is untrue or inaccurate or (ii) omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
h.	You acknowledge and understand that information about Challenges, including, but not limited to, the names of the Challengers and Challengees, the Selected Charities, the Suggested Contributions, and the amount of contributions made may be generally available to and viewable by the public at the Site or elsewhere. we won’t post what someone posted specifically, but will post aggregates and if there are few donations someone could deduce about] you are a Challenger or Challengee, you irrevocably consent to the disclosure of such information.
i.	Challengers should be aware that many states have laws that regulate charitable fund solicitation activities in those states. Challengemaker merely provides a platform to allow Challengers to connect with Challengees. Challengers who use the Services are entirely responsible for compliance with applicable law.

Challengemaker’s fee for the Services is 7% of any contributions made.  Credit card fees are an additional 2.9%. All contributions made via the Site will be forwarded directly to the Selected Charity, less Challengemaker’s fee and less any fees or other amounts paid by Challengemaker to its payment processor.

<br>
<h4>8.	RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES: BINDING ARBITRATION; NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS.</h4>
a.	You and Challengemaker shall arbitrate any and all Disputes, as follows:
i.	“Dispute” means any dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Contract, any amendments or addenda to this Contract, or the subject matter of this Contract, including, but not limited to, any contract, tort, statutory or equity claims that relate in any way to (1) this Contract, the Site, the Services, any Challenge or any Challenge Activity (collectively, the “Contract Subject Matter”), (2) the use, distribution, sale, advertising, promotion, marketing or transmission of, or participation in, of any of the Contract Subject Matter, or (3) any claims, statements, promises, descriptions, representations or warranties made in connection with the Contract Subject Matter.
ii.	This Section 8 shall apply to the resolution of Disputes.  In the event of any Dispute, the parties are encouraged to attempt to resolve the Dispute by informal means.  If the parties are not able to do so, the Dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration.
iii.	Arbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination.  Any Dispute between Challengemaker and you will be subject to binding arbitration.
iv.	Challengemaker and you agree that there shall be no jury trial or right to a jury trial, or right to any other proceeding to resolve any Dispute in any court.  In the event of any Dispute, both parties agree that this Contract will be governed, both procedurally and substantively, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sections 1-9 ("FAA") to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
v.	All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties, and any party shall have the right to prevent any actual or threatened breach of this confidentiality provision by temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive or declaratory relief in an appropriate court of law.
vi.	The parties expressly agree that any Dispute is personal to them, and any such Dispute shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration.  Neither party agrees to class arbitration, or an arbitration where a person brings a Dispute as a representative of any other person or persons.  Neither party agrees that a Dispute can be brought as a class or representative action outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other person or persons.  The parties agree that a Dispute may only be resolved through an individual arbitration and shall not be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding.
vii.	The arbitration of the Dispute will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or, in the event the AAA declines or is unable to administer the arbitration, by an arbitration forum or arbitrator that Challengemaker and you shall mutually agree upon.  If, after making a reasonable effort, Challengemaker and you are unable to agree upon an arbitration forum or arbitrator, the AAA or a court having proper jurisdiction will appoint an arbitration forum or arbitrator.  The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or the appropriate rules of any alternative arbitration forum selected by Challengemaker and you or appointed by a court, subject to the following modifications:
1.	The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who will be a licensed attorney or a former judge.
2.	As limited by the FAA, this Contract and the applicable AAA rules, the arbitrator will have the exclusive power and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions concerning the Dispute.  This does not include the power to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by this Contract as stated above.  The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration, and may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.
3.	The parties may take discovery through interrogatories, depositions and requests for production that the arbitrator determines to be necessary, with the caveat that each party shall have the right to take the deposition of at least one person for at least one day.
4.	In making any award, the arbitrator will be restricted by the Limitation of Liability provisions in this Contract (Section 7), and will not have jurisdiction to make an award to any party to the arbitration contrary to the Limitation of Liability provisions; provided however that if the enforceability of any of these restrictions is limited by the applicable substantive law or by the AAA rules, that restriction will only be enforced to the extent permitted by such law or rules.
5.	The prevailing party in any of the following matters (without regard to the Limitation of Liability provisions) will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred:  (i) a motion which any party is required to make in the courts to compel arbitration of a Dispute; (ii) any appeal of an arbitration award, whether to the arbitrator or the courts, for the purpose of vacating or modifying the award; or (iii) any action to enforce the confidentiality provisions stated in this Section 8.
6.	Challengemaker will pay the amount of any arbitration costs and fees charged by the AAA, subject to the right of Challengemaker to request that the arbitrator allocate the ultimate responsibility for that fee in a fair and reasonable manner.  Unless the arbitrator finds that you are economically unable to pay a share of the arbitrator’s fee or that it is otherwise inappropriate for you to do so, the arbitrator ultimately may decide that you are responsible for some portion of that fee in the arbitrator’s discretion.
b.	The AAA rules are available from the AAA, which can be contacted by mail at 1633 Broadway, Floor 10, New York, New York 10019, by telephone at (800) 778-7879, or through its website at www.adr.org.
<br>
<br>
<h4>9.	LIMITATION OF TIME PERIOD TO COMMENCE ANY COMPLAINT OR ACTION.</h4>  Regardless of any statute of limitations or law to the contrary, and to maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any claim or cause of action that constitutes a Dispute must be filed within one (1) year after the date on which the incident giving rise to the Dispute occurred; provided that, if the substantive law applicable to the arbitration prohibits the parties from agreeing to this limitations period, then the limitations period under the applicable substantive law shall control.  The failure of a party to file an arbitration claim within the applicable limitations period shall constitute a waiver by that party of its right to bring such a claim in any form or forum and a complete bar to any claim based on any Dispute, and the arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction to make a determination for a party that has not brought its claim within such applicable limitations period.
<br>
<br>
<h4>10.	COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS AND REMOVAL POLICY.</h4>  Challengemaker does not tolerate the posting on or submission to the Site of any Challenge, any acceptance of any Challenge, or any other content that infringes any copyright.
